This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a react application that uses the cloudinary API to upload and play videos
There is however a 20 second maximum length on the videos since it is the free service.  
  I used auth0 for user authentication and axios for http requests.

   to get started: clone this repo
   install dependencies: npm install
   to start : npm run
